\section{\label{sec:experiments} SIMULATION EXAMPLES}

In this section the simulation experiments and the results obtained are presented.
To each simulation example the algorithms were applied as presented in \autoref{sec:application}.
In all cases the output is affected by a colored noise $v(t)$ generated by a white Gaussian noise filtered by the following transfer function
\begin{equation*}
	H(q) = \frac{q^2 + 0.8q + 0.3}{q^2 - 0.8q}
\end{equation*}

The results obtained with each method are compared by the value obtained with the cost function $J_y(N)$ in \eqref{eq:jy}.
% presented here for the sampled case as
% \begin{equation}
% 	\jy = \frac{1}{N_e} \sum \limits_{t=1}^{N_e} \left( y_d(t) - y(t, \hat{\rho}_N) \right)^2
% \label{eq:jy}
% \end{equation}
% where, $N_e$ is the number of samples for the cost function calculation, $y_d(t)$ is the desired output, and $y(t, \rho_N)$ is the obtained output with the controller gains $\hat{\rho}_N$ estimated until the sample $N$, where $N$ is increased one sample at time.
Therefore, to compare numerically the obtained values it was calculated how many values for the $\jy$ found remain in the smallest value of the cost function plus the difference between the smallest and the final value of the cost function as
\begin{equation}
	q = \text{min}(\jy) + \left( \frac{f(\jy) - \text{min}(\jy)}{4} \right)
\label{eq:threshold_jy}
\end{equation}
where $f(\jy)$ corresponds to the final value of the cost function.

\subsection{Open loop case}

In this simulation experiment 500 Monte Carlo simulations of an open loop experiment were performed.
A step with 200 samples was used as input $u(t)$ for the system.
The system transfer function $G(q)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	G(q) = \frac{0.42794 (q-0.9145)}{(q-0.867) (q-0.9587)}
\label{eq:tf_system}
\end{equation}

The ideal controller $C_i(q)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	C_i(q) = \frac{0.156q - 0.1454}{q-1}
\label{eq:tf_ci}
\end{equation}

% The desired behavior is defined by the desired transfer function $T_d(q)$ given by
% \begin{equation*}
% 	T_d(q) = \frac{0.066759 (q-0.9321) (q-0.9145)}{(q-0.8438) (q^2 - 1.915q + 0.9176)}
% \end{equation*}

As mentioned before the parameters were estimated through the VRFT method increasing number of samples for each realization.
The values used for the thresholds are: $\eta_c = 60\eta_{min} $ for the smallest singular value method, $\eta_n = 0.02$ for the reciprocal condition number method, and $\eta_\gamma = 15$ as initial start for the proposed method.


The confidence interval of the methods is presented in \autoref{fig:conf_exp1}.
As can be seen, independently of the method used the parameters estimated are polarized, this occurs because the simplest approach of the VRFT method is applied and the signals are affected by noise.

\end{figure}


% In order to evaluate all the realizations it was calculated how many points found remain in the smallest value of the cost function plus the difference between the smallest and the final value of the cost function as
% \begin{equation}
% 	q = \text{min}(J_y(\rho)) + \left( \frac{\text{max}(J_y(\rho)) - \text{min}(J_y(\rho))}{4} \right)
% \label{eq:threshold_jy}
% \end{equation}

The numeric comparative was calculated as in \eqref{eq:threshold_jy} and the values found are presented in \autoref{tab:comp_exp1}.
% \textcolor{blue}{It is possible to see that using any of the algorithms can give better results then using the entire collected data.}

  Reciprocal condition number & 294 (58.8\%) \\
  Smallest singular value & 118 (23.6\%) \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The closed loop response obtained for one realization randomly chosen is presented in \autoref{fig:step_simple_ol}.
It is possible to see that the obtained responses are close to the desired one, different from the obtained response when all data is used to estimate the parameters.

  \caption{\label{fig:step_simple_ol} Step responses.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Closed loop case}
In this case the same system transfer functions for $G(q)$ in \eqref{eq:tf_system} and $C_i(q)$ in \eqref{eq:tf_ci} were used.
The controller that was in the system when the experiments were performed is given by
\begin{equation*}
	C(q) = \frac{0.1469q - 0.1388}{q-1}
\end{equation*}
% The block diagram for the experiments performed in closed loop is presented in \autoref{fig:closed_loop}.

% \end{figure}


% \subsubsection{Step sequences}
In this case, a step sequence was used as input reference $r(t)$, and 500 Monte Carlo simulations were performed.
Here, also for each realization, the parameters were estimated using the VRFT method with the number of samples increasing one sample each time.
The values used for the thresholds are: $\eta_c = 80\eta_{min} $ for the smallest singular value method, $\eta_n = 0.02$ for the reciprocal condition number method, and $\eta_\gamma = 35$ as initial start for the proposed method.
The confidence interval of the methods is presented in \autoref{fig:polarization_cl_deg_r}.
As can be seen the estimated parameters are polarized.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \def\svgwidth{\columnwidth}
  {\footnotesize\import{images/pdf/}{polarization_cl_deg_r.pdf_tex}}
  \caption{\label{fig:polarization_cl_deg_r} Confidence interval of the methods.}
\end{figure}

The numeric comparative was calculated and is presented in Table~\ref{tab:comp_cl_deg_r}.
\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Comparative -- Experiment 2 \label{tab:comp_cl_deg_r}}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
Method & Below $q$\\
\midrule
Proposed method & 358 (71.6\%) \\
Reciprocal condition number & 139 (27.8\%) \\
Smallest singular value & 104 (20.8\%) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The cost function was calculated for four randomly selected realizations and is presented in \autoref{fig:jy_cl_deg_r}.
Each cost function was calculated with increasing number of samples and the dots indicate the ending of the intervals returned by each method.
It is possible to see that reducing the number of samples can lead to a small value for the cost function compared to the value found using all data.

\subsection{Mismatched case}
This simulation example comprises the case when the ideal controller does not belongs to the controller class.
In this case, also 500 Monte Carlo simulations were performed and a step was used as system input $u(t)$.
The parameters were calculated using the VRFT approach for the mismatched case as described in \autoref{sub:vrft}.
The system transfer function $G(q)$ is given by
\[
	G(q) = \frac{0.19963 (q-0.9783)}{(q-0.8513) (q-0.965)}
\]

The controller class used to identify the controller's parameters is a PI, while the ideal controller is a PID given by
\[
	C_i(q) = \frac{0.1557 q^2 - 0.1485 q + 0.0354}{q^2 - q}
\]

The values used for the thresholds are: $\eta_c = \num{1e5}\eta_{min} $ for the smallest singular value method, $\eta_n = 0.002$ for the reciprocal condition number method, and $\eta_\gamma = 15$ as initial start for the proposed method.
The numeric comparative was calculated and is presented in Table~\ref{tab:comp_ol_mismatched}.
It is possible to see that for this case the obtained results are not so attractive.
That can also be seen through the Bode diagrams in figures \ref{fig:bode_prop}, \ref{fig:bode_cond} and \ref{fig:bode_sv}.

Smallest singular value & 84 (16.8\%) \\
